How Chronos AI Works:

User enters a message

Chronos checks:

Task intent (add / update / count)

Priority or focus intent

If matched → handled locally (fast)

Otherwise → forwarded to AI backend

AI response returned to UI

Tasks are synced globally via Context API

This hybrid approach ensures:

Fast responses

Offline safety

🤖 Real AI intelligence when available

How to Run the Project
Install dependencies
npm install

Start Expo
npx expo start

Run on:

Web

Android Emulator

Physical Device (Expo Go)

Environment Notes:

AI API keys are handled in the backend

n8n workflows must be ACTIVE

Webhooks are securely triggered from the app

Future Enhancements:

Voice input for Chronos

Smart meeting summaries

Calendar-task auto syncing

Notification reminders

Multi-user authentication

Cloud task storage

Team & Hackathon:

This project was built as part of a hackathon, focusing on:

Real-world productivity problems

AI + automation integration

Clean UX with scalable architecture

🏁 Conclusion

Nexi with Chronos AI is more than a to-do app —
it’s a personal productivity companion that thinks, organizes, and assists intelligently.
